# Welcome to The Great RGB Color Game (revised in React.js)

Hi! My name is Matthew Palmer. This repo serves as the revised vanilla javascript application "The Great RGB Color Game" originated from Udemy's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by instructor Colt Steele. A passion project of mine where I aim to convert it into a React application.

## How to Use & Run

Assuming you have `Node.js` and can run node packages in your IDE of choice (I recommend VsCode), please clone this repo by typing `git clone https://www.github.com/matthewpalmer9/rgbcolorgame` into your terminal.

Once cloned, type `npm install` to ensure you have the necessary dependecies installed for this application. To start the application, type `npm start` into your terminal and the application will start the server which can be viewed in the browser under LocalHost. 

Typically, you can expect the application to open itself in your default browser. There have been issues with `Firefox` in the past, but I have corrected the necessary syntax to function across all browsers.

If you have any questions or issues, please contact me at `matthewpalmer9@outlook.com`.
